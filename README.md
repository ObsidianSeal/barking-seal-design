# Barking Seal Design

I have acquired the domain [barkingseal.design](https://barkingseal.design/) with the intention of possible future use.

[Barking Seal Design](https://barkingseal.design/) is the name I put on my graphic design work to seem more professional.

There’s nothing on the website at the moment.

My other domains:

-    **THE ORIGINAL:** [pinniped.page](https://pinniped.page/) — fun, games, tools, etc.
-    **THE SHORT:** [ite.fyi](https://ite.fyi/) — links, files, etc.
-    **THE PROFESSIONAL:** [bmg.engineer](https://bmg.engineer/) — serious stuff, files, etc.
